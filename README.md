I created a react app that utilizes the redux slice method, the reason why I choose slice is because using the full redux wasn't needed and the slice method allows me to redux to the degree that I need it for.

I also pull the data from the express server so the app can interact with data from the backend. I didn't go the full length and save any updated data to the backend. That would be the next step to creating persistent data. 

Anyways please enjoy the experience and I look forward to your feedback
